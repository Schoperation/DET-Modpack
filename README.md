# Packin' DET

The Newest, Ultimate Modpack from JaredSheep & Co.!
Basically the core of ATM8, with some different world gen mods, and whatever we want later on!

## Downloading

### CurseForge

- In the CurseForge Launcher, search for "Packin' DET" and create a new profile with it.
- Or, head on over to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/packin-det and click Install.
- Once everything's downloaded, click play on the profile, wait for the Minecraft Launcher, then click Play, then wait some more!

### MultiMC and Pals

- Should be similar to the CurseForge steps; if you're on a fork that can download CurseForge modpacks, you can search for "Packin' DET" and download it from there. Otherwise, you may have to do it manually...

### Manually

- Head on over to the righthand side, and click Releases. The first one should be the latest one. 
- Download the attached ZIP file (NOT the source code...)
- For CurseForge
    - Under My Modpacks, click on Create Custom Profile
    - Click on import, under Or import a previously created profile
    - Select the downloaded ZIP file
    - Wait
    - Profit
- For MultiMC, Prism Launcher, GDLauncher, anything with "instances"
    - Create New Instance
    - Select the option similar to "Import from ZIP"
    - Select the downloaded ZIP file
    - Wait
    - Profit


## Updating

### CurseForge / MultiMC and Pals

- In the launcher, edit your modpack profile where you should be able to change the version you're on. When a new version is out, you can select that and it'll automatically update.


### Semi-Automatically

Packwiz, the modpack manager I use, has a way of updating semi-automatically that works with MultiMC, or any launcher that allows custom java commands to be run on launch (don't think CurseForge allows that).

Follow steps 1, 2, and ... 1 (lol) in this guide to set that up.
