# Updating

Unfortunately, the only real way right now to auto-update is for me to create a curseforge project. If there's enough demand, then I can go ahead and bite the bullet; though it won't be fun going through the approval process with every new file, and getting yelled at for saying it's "just for my friends and I."

However, PackWiz, the modpack manager I use, does have a way that works with MultiMC, or any launcher that allows custom java commands to be run on launch (don't know if curseforge allows that).

Follow steps 1, 2, and ... 1 (lol) in this guide to set that up.
